# Hey, I'm Michael 👋  
I'm a Computer Science student at UC Santa Cruz passionate about full stack development, Computer Vision, AI, and clean, scalable design.  
I enjoy building tools that make technical workflows easier — most recently, I've been building **RTFM** and **Sluggle**.
### 🚀 What I'm Working On
- 🧩 **RTFM** – Backend system that allows a Discord bot to recall and re-answer previously answered questions using semantic search. Built with FastAPI, PostgreSQL, ChromaDB, and Gemini for embedding and retrieval.  
- 🕶️ **Visage** – Face-recognition memory assistant for MentraOS that helps cure the social void by remembering people you meet. Built with Bun + MentraOS SDK for the responsive frontend and Python/FastAPI + PostgreSQL + pgvector on the backend to capture conversations, encode faces (DeepFace/Facenet), and reliably recall folks later.
- 🌱 **Personal Website** – Showcasing my projects, technical writing, and portfolio with a clean, responsive design (React + Tailwind).
### 🧰 Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python, Typescript, JavaScript   
- **Frameworks:** FastAPI, React, TailwindCSS  
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, ChromaDB  
- **Tools:** Git, Docker
